# Messing around with Python and CLI

Fizz Buzz was a game I played a lot with my siblings when we were young. The logic
of the game was raised during my Full Stack development course as a small
challenge. Having found the logic very simple to work out, I decided to write the
game to a playable standard. There may be errors I have overlooked and bugs that
I am unaware of, but the game seems to work and cover all erroneous inputs.

I quite enjoyed the couple of afternoons spent playing around with this. If you
want to try it, you just need to run **fizzwozzbuzz.py** in a Python environment.

If you find an error please let me know. If you would like to enlighten me with
better practices, a more Pythonic approach or any other tips to improve my
overall standard and development process, I would love to hear from you!
